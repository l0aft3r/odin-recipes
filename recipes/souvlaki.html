    <h2>What is Souvlaki?</h2>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>

        <li>3 pounds pork tenderloin, cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 medium yellow onions, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 medium green bell peppers, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
        <li>skewers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, garlic, and oregano together in a large glass bowl.</li>
        <li>Add pork, onions, and bell peppers, and stir until coated. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>

        <li>Cook on the preheated grill, turning frequently, until pork is no longer pink in the middle, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
